# Typescript `undoable` Implementation

## Success Criteria
[ ] Module must expose a default export.
[ ] Default export must be a higher-order function.
[ ] Default function must have a call signature of (reducer: Function).
[ ] Default function must return a function which conforms to Redux's `Reducer` interface.
[ ] Implementation must be written in TypeScript.
[ ] Implementation must be thoroughly tested.

## Goals
[ ] To learn about and implement a higher-order reducer.
[ ] To continue improving TypeScript knowledge/ability.
[ ] To continue improving unit testing knowledge/ability.
[ ] To apply TDD methodology.
[ ] To apply best practices re: use of git, including: commit messages; scope/size of commits; etc.
